<h1> Final Project </h1>
     <p>   
            For our final project my partner, Saida Fernandez, and I decided to create a variation of the classic 
            Pac-Man game. Our game is called Snake Pac-Man. In our game Pac-Man doesnt go through a maze, instead 
            the game is completely open like the snake game. The object of the game is to eat 15 lemons that appear
            randomly along the screen by hovering over them and clicking. But like Pac-Man our game has ghosts
            that you need to avoid, if they touch you then you lose your lives and eventually the game.
